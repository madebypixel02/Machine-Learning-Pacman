We added a new folder. Here it is its structure

	datasets: Contains all the data related with our ml agents
		
		data_collection: Contains all the datasets we generated
			phase4: A new folder dedicated for saving datasets from phase4
		
		models: There they are all the weka models we made

		wekaThings: Contains some saved filters and expressions in order to reuse them along the datasets

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Also we added some extra files:
	requiremts.txt: contains the libraries used for this tutorial
	stack.py: contains the stack data structure... Used in the behavior2 for the BasicAgentAA
	Practice 1 Report.pdf contains the report of all the work done.
